# Youth Career
The app to help students and youth pick career path, see what skills they need to learn and get jobs. 

This app is available at [http://youthcareer.github.io]. The major work of this app was initially built by a group of U of T grads for the Canadian Open Data Experience hackathon and was declared the winner. For the update, as part of the Apps for Alberta challenge, the data set used (after extensive research as it needed to complement the existing app and add further value to the youths from Alberta) was the apprenticeship

## Description:
This application is aimed at helping young Canadians discover, research and choose future career paths. It allows them to search by various professions and see projected employment statistics and job prospects for the chosen field. It also shows information about current job postings for that occupation from GlassDoor using their API. Youths from Alberta would be further able to see relevant apprenticeship positions within their province thus helping them make better career decisions.

The app is designed to make it easy to search for different occupations and titles. It ties together this information from a variety of sources, including the Open Data sets.

Another important feature is that the app lists the number of current postings per occupation, which will help young people make decisions about their future careers. Through our app, they can discover what kind of education, skills, and requirements they need for different jobs.
